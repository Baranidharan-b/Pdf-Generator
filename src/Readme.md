# PDF Generation Service

This project is a PDF generation service built using **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf**. The service generates PDF invoices based on input data and returns either a newly generated PDF or a cached version if it already exists.

## Features

- **Generate or Retrieve PDF**: The service either generates a new PDF invoice or returns an existing one based on the request data.
- **Thymeleaf Template Rendering**: The invoice PDF is generated by rendering a Thymeleaf template.
- **PDF Generation**: The generated HTML content is converted to PDF using a custom `PdfGenerator`.
- **Caching**: Once a PDF is generated, it is saved and reused for subsequent requests with the same data.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 20** or higher
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (depending on the build tool)
- **Spring Boot**
- **Thymeleaf**
